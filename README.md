## 📌 Project Overview

**Tas3eera** is a community-driven mobile application designed to organize and display product prices in a **transparent and accessible** way.  
The app addresses significant price variations between stores and regions, especially under current circumstances such as displacement and limited access to central markets.

Tas3eera relies on **user-contributed price reports**, linked to geographic locations, to provide an approximate and up-to-date price reference before heading to the market.

- Price variation between city centers and peripheral or remote areas.
- Difficulty accessing central markets due to displacement or distance.
- Lack of a reliable and frequently updated price reference.
- Consumers relying on guesswork or physical visits to discover prices.

## 💡 Solution

**Tas3eera** provides a practical solution by:

- Crowdsourcing product prices from the community.
